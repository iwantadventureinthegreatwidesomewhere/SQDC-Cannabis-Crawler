## Fetch all the cannabis products available near you.

Using the SQDC can be painfully unreliable. Oftentimes the majority of their displayed products are out of stock or unavailable. With this Node.js SQDC crawler, you can now quickly fetch all available cannabis products near you.

The crawler fetches not only the name of available products, but also additional useful details such as species, type, and THC. It also provides a SQDC website link so you can swiftly navigate to a product of your liking.

Use the command line to install the Node.js crawler's dependencies (with npm) and then run the application. Enjoy!

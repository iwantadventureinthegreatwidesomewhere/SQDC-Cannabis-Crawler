# SQDC Cannabis Crawler

Using the SQDC can be painfully unreliable. Oftentimes the majority of their displayed products are out of stock or unavailable. With this Node.js SQDC crawler, you can now quickly fetch all available cannabis products near you.

The crawler fetches the name of available products, and also additional useful details such as species, type, and THC content. It also provides a SQDC website link so you can swiftly navigate to a product of your liking.

## Installation and Usage

To use this crawler, make sure to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed on your machine.

Use the command line to install the Node.js crawler's dependencies.

```console
npm install
```

Finally, run the Node.js application.

```console
node index.js
```

It's as simple as that! Enjoy!
